Respond and Recover from a Data Breach Experiment

## Introduction

This project documents the process of responding to and recovering from a simulated data breach within a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment. The objective was to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, isolate and contain the breach, recover compromised systems, and ensure compliance with security frameworks.

## Google Cloud Services Used

- Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC)
- Compute Engine
- Cloud Storage
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Firewall Rules

## Project Architecture

The project simulated a real-world scenario where a retail company, Cymbal Retail, experienced a data breach. The architecture involved:

- A compromised Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) that was used to access sensitive data.
- A publicly accessible Cloud Storage bucket containing sensitive information.
- VPC firewall rules that allowed overly permissive access to the network.
- Security Command Center to identify and view vulnerabilities.
